        <h2> Tips </h2>
        <div class="well">
 <div class = "well-content">
          <h3>Do your homework!</h3>
          <p>Educate yourself about your child’s illness. With that you can research treatments and therapy appropriate for your child’s needs. 
          This is also a good way to understand symptoms and know what to do when they occur. </p>
        <br>
          <h3>Team Work</h3>
            <p>You and your child need to be a team! She/he is going to need all the support they can get. You remember to respect and try to understand their feelings as much as possible. 
            Keep in mind to have discipline with your child, set your expectations to correspond with your child’s condition. </p>
        <br>
          <h3>Focus on the positive</h3>
          <p> There will be frustrating and painful moments in this journey. Try to see the bright side because your child will follow your attitude. Be a role model to your child. Show them how to problem solve and express how they feel. 
           Try to stay calm throughout this journey. <p>
        <br>
           <h3> Listen! </h3>
           <p> Please refrain from using phrases like “You’re fine!”, “Stop overreacting”, or “I have other things to deal with”. Your child will think their feelings don’t matter and will stop talking to you, this could lead them to dangerous situations. 
           Let them be open to express their feelings so that you can get a better understanding. Have discussions about their day, just let them talk. </p>
